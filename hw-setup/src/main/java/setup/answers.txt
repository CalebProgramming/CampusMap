1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Because the test class pass in a zero, and Fibonacci throw new exception when n <= 0, when n is 0,
fibonacci term is actually 1, so I change condition to throw new exception when n < 0.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Because for index 2, it is suppose to be 1 + 1, because 1, 1, 2(index2), 3, .... and I change
else statement to be [n-1] + [n-2] instead of minus. Also, only terms on index 0 and 1 value 1,
so condition in else if should be n <= 1 instead of n <=2.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
Because it pass in a 0 index, and 0 index should be 1, but it is captured by n <= 0 condition
and throw an exception, so I change the condition from n <= 0 to n < 0.
